# Why this Repository
As oAuth functionality is fundamentally complicated to implement using tech stack such is ReactJS, NodeJS, MySQL & JWT. I wanted to specifically add Google's oAuth2.0 functionality in one my Product but this was the thing which i was going to do for very first time so i was a bit confused about how to recozine or to know whether the user is login or not and many of the developers are comfortable with JWT rather than any other library and the main thing is how to store data in Database and what kind of data to store in database specially in MySQL. I haven't found any Repository or Blogs or any YouTube video which will explain oAuth2.0 easily including adding Tokens in user's cookies and Storing Data in MySQL , So i thought this Repository will help you to not to get confused with Google's oAuth2.0
